## AI Usage Transparency

Throughout the development of this project, I leveraged various AI tools in a controlled and transparent manner to complement my own engineering, analytical, and design work. All major decisions, implementations, and validations were performed under my direct supervision, with AI tools serving as secondary assistants rather than autonomous contributors.

### System and Architecture Design
The complete **system and architecture design** of the project — including backend–frontend integration, analytics workflow, database schema, and real-time data flow — was fully conceptualized, structured, and implemented by me.  
I designed the modular architecture independently, ensuring clear separation of layers for data ingestion, analytics computation, and visualization. No AI tools were used for system-level planning or architectural decision-making.

### Code Assistance Using AI Tools
During the coding phase, I used **Claude** and **GitHub Copilot** to assist with specific aspects of implementation and debugging, while retaining full authorship and accountability over the final code.

- **Claude (Anthropic)** was used primarily for:
  - Exploring alternative ways to structure certain Python modules.
  - Refining docstrings, comments, and improving readability.
  - Understanding advanced statistical or machine learning techniques before implementing them.
  - Example prompts included:
    - “Explain how GARCH volatility models are implemented using Python and statsmodels.”
    - “Describe an efficient way to integrate Z-Score and RSI calculations in a live data pipeline.”
    - “Generate pseudocode for a backtesting engine with entry/exit logic.”

  These interactions were purely for guidance and concept explanation — all code implementations were written, optimized, and validated by me manually.

- **GitHub Copilot** (within Visual Studio Code) was used for:
  - Auto-completion of repetitive boilerplate code.
  - Suggesting small syntax corrections or import statements.
  - Fixing occasional runtime or type-related issues during iterative testing.

  I reviewed every Copilot suggestion carefully to ensure correctness, maintainability, and adherence to the intended logic of the system.  
  AI suggestions were not accepted automatically and were always modified or rewritten to fit the project’s standards.

### Prompts and Workflow
AI prompts were used in a structured manner to accelerate specific phases of development:
- For **conceptual clarity**, I used Claude to refine my understanding of mathematical models and analytics logic.
- For **implementation polish**, I used Copilot to assist in error detection and code refactoring.
- For **documentation improvement**, I occasionally requested phrasing suggestions to make README sections more precise and consistent.

Every AI-generated or suggested snippet was reviewed, tested, and integrated under my  supervision, ensuring that the intellectual integrity of the project remained intact.
